                        <p>The first unit covers information technology systems.
                            We investigate the functions of computer systems and the consequences of their use in both personal and professional settings.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            We also look at the relationships between the hardware and software that make up IT systems, how they work individually and together, and how users interact with IT systems.
                            <br>
                            <br>

                        <p>We learned how to design, create, test, and evaluate a relation database system that handles information in Unit 2. We looked at how data is structured and how to use things like normalisation to build effective design solutions for creating a database.

                            <br>
                            After learning all of this, we took a 5-hour exam that was divided into two parts: part A and part B.</p>

                            We looked at how companies use social media to market their products and services in Unit 3, as well as building our own social media campaigns. We investigated several social media sites, their benefits and drawbacks, and how businesses may benefit from them. 
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            We also gathered data to evaluate which postings perform better than others. Data including when your audience is most active, what their interests are, their demographics, and so on.

                            In Unit 4, we'll learn how to create, construct, and test a range of computer programmes by studying the principles and consequences of programming languages. Aside from that, you'll be learning the properties of several programming languages as well as the techniques that underpin them.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            We've also studied the phases of computational thinking as well as the principles of designing and building computer programmes. We were given a variety of computer programmes to test and analyse the programmes' aims in terms of computational thinking and design concepts.

                            So far, my favourite.
                            The responsibility of designing and constructing a website utilising HTML, CSS, and JavaScript has been assigned to us.
                            As a result, this website exists.
                            To pique our target audience's interest, we've used techniques like occam's razor, hicks law, and whitespace.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            We've also been looking at numerous websites to evaluate how well they follow these principles, such as simplicity and ease of use, as well as how well they target their audience.

                            The creation of mobile apps is the subject of Unit 7.
                            We've been looking into mobile apps, as well as the design and development of various mobile apps and their intended uses.
                            We've been studying how mobile apps interact with various devices, as well as the various technologies employed in those apps, such as orientation and GPS.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            We are also focusing on developing our own mobile app in addition to investigating mobile apps.
                            We're making a smartphone app to teach fundamental mathmatics to kids.
                            We must also include interactive elements such as vibrations and effects.
