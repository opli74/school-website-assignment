                                <p>Midkent College has been around for nearly 100 years. Its origins can be traced back to the technical institutes established in Medway towns in the 1890s and Maidstone around 1918. 
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                In 1954, the college began offering courses at the Horsted Centre in Chatham. On 5 April the following year, the Duke of Edinburgh officially opened the site as Medway College of Technology. Medway College of Technology and Maidstone Technical College merged in 1966 to form Medway and Maidstone College of Technology. 
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                In 1968, the purpose-built City Way site in Rochester opened as an additional college site.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                In 1978, the college's name was changed to Mid-Kent College of Higher and Further Education, before dropping the hyphen and space, as well as the latter part of the title, to become MidKent College in October 2008. The college's students were famous for their Rag Day parade throughout the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s. This resulted in a carnival procession through the Medway Towns. The parade began at Gillingham train station and ended at Rochester's esplanade.

                                <p>The college has two main campuses: Gillingham's Medway Campus and Maidstone's Maidstone Campus. All courses at the Horsted Centre in Chatham and the City Way Centre in Rochester were relocated to a new combined campus on Prince Arthur Road in Gillingham in September 2009. The new campus cost a total of £86 million, including more than £40 million in Learning and Skills Council (LSC) funding. It provides training in a variety of fields, including construction, performing arts, music, and catering. The Princess Royal officially opened the Medway Campus on Thursday, March 25, 2010.

                                <br>
                                In late 2012, work began on a £22 million refurbishment of the Maidstone Campus to bring its facilities up to the Medway Campus's standards. The Maidstone Campus development also includes a refurbishment of the University for the Creative Arts' Maidstone campus, which is also located at Oakwood Park and was purchased by the College in 2011. Both the City Way and Horsted shopping centres were demolished in 2014.

                                Now the ultra-modern Medway Campus of MidKent College houses some of the best vocational training facilities in the country. The cutting-edge campus houses a variety of high-quality workshops and laboratories, as well as a large Learning Resource Centre, refectory, and welcoming social zones – all built to the highest standards and entirely focused on students' needs.
